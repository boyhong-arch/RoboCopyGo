# What is ReboCopy Go+?
ReboCopy Go+ is a graphical user interface (GUI) software developed based on Microsoft Windows' built-in command-line tool Robocopy.exe. Its primary purpose is to enable everyday users to easily utilize the powerful but complex functionalities of Robocopy.

# Key Features of ReboCopy Go+
- Robust Foundation: Built upon Microsoft's official Robocopy (Robust File Copy), it inherits the efficiency and stability of the native tool, supporting features like multi-threaded copying, resume capability, and preservation of file attributes.

- User-Friendly Interface: The software provides an intuitive checkbox interface and right-click menus for Robocopy's command-line parameters, significantly lowering the learning curve.

- Practical Functions: Beyond basic file copying, it offers convenient features such as "shutdown, standby, or hibernate after job completion," "shell integration into folder right-click menus," and "install/uninstall" options.

- Performance: Some comparative tests indicate that ReboCopy Go+ can complete file copy tasks faster than well-known software like FastCopy under certain conditions. However, actual transfer speeds can vary depending on hardware configuration, file quantity, and other factors.

# In Summary
ReboCopy Go+ can be thought of as an easy-to-use "shell" for the system's built-in Robocopy tool. If you need to perform large-scale file backups or synchronization, find learning command-line tools challenging, or simply want a more efficient and reliable experience than Windows' default copy-paste function, this software is an excellent choice.

If the parameter settings become disorganized, you can restore the default options. It also supports automatic shutdown after copying for unattended operations. In cases where backup directories are mistakenly flagged by antivirus software, it provides a one-click solution to add trusted folders. Should you no longer need the software, it offers a complete uninstall feature that removes all traces from your system. Notably, it includes shell extension support, allowing integration into the right-click context menu for folders：
